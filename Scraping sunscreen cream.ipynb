So I never expect topical agents to improve wrinkles even if they claim to. I do think products with a lot of vitamin C, which this one has, help with freckles or sun spots. My faint wrinkles are still here but the few spots from sun exposure are dramatically lightened or gone after using this for several months. This leaves my 50s skin which is still oily in the T-zone shiny, so I have to use blotting papers for a normal look without makeup or before applying makeup. The extra moisture is good for the neck, it helps to make my horizontal neck wrinkles not look so bad during the day.\",\n",

I'm a totally fan of sun protection and a true believer of how a beuty rutine can provides great results if you are disciplined. Now I'm 35 and people says that I look ten years younger. Nevertheless, in the last few years my cream obssesion has diminished: some facialcreams give you a very superficial effect, maybe, only remarkable a few days after you use it. In the other hand a lot of brands that I used to liked get very expensive and maybe kind of ordinary. A common problem with sun protection products is this kind of unnecesary whiteness... it makes you look kind of fake and flat coloured skin, even if it is a sheer formula or promising a natural color. This cc cream s a totally enhancer... It make you look your face less boring, and also pretty much healthier.... it really really worths it....\"]},\n",

I was looking for a sunscreen that my daughters (3 and 5 at the time) could use by themselves and this is very easy to apply and it doesn\\'t sting their eyes! They love the fact that it\\'s a brush on - just like make-up! My older one brings it to school and reapplies before going to the playground. The packaging (brush) is great for her backpack or jacket pocket. Kids in her class ask to use her sunscreen all the time. I had a mom call me about the sunscreen because they can\\'t get their daughter to reapply sunscreen at school. Once they got it, their daughter loved it and used it. It is a little pricey but if the girls use it, it is worth every penny and it last forever. They have never burned using this, even at a 5 hour pool party without reapplying! I bought them the Perfectly Clear Sparkle. It\\'s the slightly tinted with sparkles. They love the sparkles and it lets me know that they\\'ve covered their entire face. Some reviewers complain about the shininess, make sure you didn\\'t buy the \"sparkle\" one. I also use it over a daily moisturizer. I like the fact that it gives me a little color and the SPF is great! Again, I brushed it on before going to a pool party and we were in the sun for over 5 hours and I didn\\'t get burned even though I didn\\'t reapply. My back did get burned.

And the most important thing, I do a lot of manual labour in hot weather, I sweat a lot. This so far is the ONLY product with this high SPF that when I have sweat run into my eyes it doesn’t sting and make my eyes bloodshot. I reckon I could wear make up under this too,',\n",
       "   \"AntiAgim I'm in the sun a lot in summer. This has great protection.\",\n",
       "   \"exactly what I wanted I first learned about Obagi a few weeks ago at the dermatologist. Since turning 40 my combo-oily skin has changed & it's making me crazy! Specifically, cystic acne & brown spots. I was advised to use an spf of at least 40. Trouble is, every SPF product I've ever used (face sunscreen OR moisturiser with SPF) left my face looking and feeling like an oily mess, including the matte versions. That I was reluctant & doubtful I would find anything suitable for my needs was an understatement.After doing some extensive research I opted to try this product. Boy am I glad I did!!A little goes a long way to cover face, neck, & chest. It's not heavy, greasy, runny, slimy, or smelly. Blends & absorbs quickly & easy. NO WHITE RESIDUE and it is matte! This is NOT like anything you'll find at Target or from Banana Boat, Coppertone, or Neutrogena.Doesn't sting my eyes from sweat while out in the sun or washing my face.It's lovely.The only con is the price, but well worth the money spent.\",\n",
       "   \"Best sunscreen I've tried yet! I tried this sunscreen because I wanted something with an SPF 50 that would be gentle, effective, and non-greasy. This Obagi sunscreen is the best I've tried yet. In addition to having the qualities of being an effective sunscreen, this one goes on the skin smoothly and is not greasy! And one of the biggest pluses: It does not give my face that chalky-whitish look that many other sunscreens do. It is not irritating to my problem-prone skin. I will be sticking with this one!\",\n",
       "   'excellent sun protection for a Queenslander I love the way it glides on easily and actually improves the texture of the skin while protecting fully from the harsh Queensland sun.',\n",
       "   'Best Sunscreen I found to go under makeup. Obagi nu derm products are the only products i found to get rid of my hyperpigmentation. Ive tried microdermabration, chemical peels and various other products. Within 5 weeks of using the nu derm line my hyperpigmentation is almost gone and this sunscreen keeps new hyperpigmentation from forming. Its non greasy which i love!',\n",
       "   \"Long-time Obagi SPF user I've been using the Obagi SPF 35 products for years. I think this is the first time I've used the SPF 50, though. It does indeed absorb quickly and doesn't leave a shiny finish. My morning regime, after cleansing, is SkinCeuticals CE Ferrulic on face, neck, chest. Let that dry, then apply the Obagi SPF product.\",\n",
       "   \"still uncertain about its effectiveness i've been using this product for about 2 months and yet freckles still appear after a couple of times of sun exposures. the ingredients of this sunblock should block out all UV whatever that is harmful to my skin but i dont see the results...yet. during the first week of application, my skin had a slight burning feeling when i sweat.\",\n",
       "   'Excellent sunscreen I really like this sunscreen and it is very effective, even on tropical sun, super light and easy to apply, even my super oily skin, stays almost shine free all day. I use a lots of peeling, so always do wear it, on a daily basis. Please note, if your get allergic reaction on physical sunscreens, then make a break with peels/retinols/aha/bha etc, the reaction of the skin is related to a ongoing stress of the skin, so please use always a physical sunscreen and make breaks with peels from time to time, use only a 20% vit c product for a month for skin regeneration, Salvo',\n",
       "   \"My all-time favorite sunblock I've tried lots of sunblocks with varying results, but this one from Obagi really delivers. It has a high SPF and is very protective, but is also lightweight and dries to a matte finish. It's not oily, sticky, or greasy so it's a pleasure to use and is great under makeup. This is the only sunblock I will use on my face and it has a permanent place on my makeup table.\"]},\n",

I was just hoping since this was made especially for oily skin, it would work well. It did feel nice and smooth (thanks to the dimethicone), but it just sat on top of my skin and gathered oil. If you currently use a skin primer and love that feel, since those are just straight dimethicone, you will probably love this and you could even skip your primer. It just wasn't for my skin. Also, it is VERY small. I use a lot of sunscreen on my face and neck to make sure I'm getting enough coverage and this would not have lasted very long.

I’ve tried just the sunscreen but it’s too thick under makeup. This one is perfect and protects your skin from the sun. I’ve never gotten a sunburn whatsoever while using this!',\n",
       "   \"Great product! I have very fair skin, and this seems to blend beautifully and just make me look like I have nice, even coloring. I'm uncertain how it would look on people with darker skintones, but it makes me look very fresh. The consistency is more watery than other sunscreens I've used, so it is easy to spread. I feel a little dry afterwards, but have only used it in the winter, I suspect in the summer it would feel perfect.\",\n",
       "   'Good stuff My friend recommended this sunscreen and I can’t believe I doubted her and didn’t order it immediately. I love this product! It’s a bit liquid-y but it goes on your face smooth and not heavy. It’s also got a slight tint which is perfect. I don’t wear makeup. I use some moisturizer, then apply this sunscreen after a few minutes. Then primer. Then some foundation and powder. That’s it. Highly recommend.',\n",
       "   \"A winner I used this product all summer after facial basal cancer removal. Non irritating, smooth, light weight, I layer this sunscreen under foundation or use some dusting powder alone. It is matte, yet somehow iridescent and pore minimizing. I have had no sun related skin redness or inflammation. I am blonde and light skinned, this zinc oxide works for me......even though they claim it works for all skin tones, Im not sure.......maybe try it on the 'high burn areas' like nose, chest and see.\",\n",
       "   \"The best This sunscreen has diminished most my need for any other foundation, even though it isn't heavy in the slightest. All I do is put a light dusting of my Jane Iredale mineral powder over the top and I am set. It feels like velvet, and leaves my skin with a dewy, youthful glow. It provides such strong protection, and my face looks clearer and more balances already. I love it and have already bought another to stock up!\",\n",
       "   \"Best sunscreen This glides on like a dream. No white marks at all. The natural tint means I can actually go without foundation too if I want, even though it's nice and subtle. It makes you skin feel genuinely velvety soft. I've noticed an improvement in my complexion from the sun protection, even only after two weeks use. I love this and will continue to buy it. Highly recommended.\",\n",

In the summer, I use this alone, but in the winter when my skin is more dry, I apply a light moisturizer before the sunscreen. I am fair and the tint works perfectly for my skin tone. Most days I wear this and skip foundation. Another bonus, it doesn't sting my eyes if i get sweaty.\",\n",

The ivory has a wonderful orange-blossom smell and beautiful sheen - like I get complimented all the time on my even toned skin and glow, and I'm 48, and this protects without any chemicals. On the downside, I have to mix multiple colors since none of the limited selection matches my olive skin, but that's not that big a deal - I just put in equal parts of tan or sand and ivory. Another issue is that the tinted colors will stain a white or light colored top (I put it on my neck and chest too). But, it's still the best sunscreen out there for sensitive skin.\",\n",

It is easier to use then the Clarins product (although it has it's uses) and has a higher SPF. At first I was a little put off by the color from the tube, but it goes on so smoothly and seems to just blend into my very fair skin. Also seems to be a good base for my eye make-up. I use it over an eye cream (overkill? Don't know). Glad I like it because I signed up for auto refills.\",\n",

       "   \"Pills so badly! I had high hopes for this sunscreen but was very disappointed. The pros are that it has a nice non-greasy texture, and it doesn't leave a white cast. The con is that it pills SO BADLY. I have tried dozens of sunscreens, and none have come close to this amount of pilling. It left me with crumbs all over my face. The only thing I had underneath was a Skinceuticals vitamin c product. I applied it at the recommended 1/4 teaspoon for face and neck.\",\n",
       "   'Best mineral sunscreen! This is an amazing Suncream for the face. For the first sunscreen layer I use the replenix sunscreen spray called \"Replenix Sheer Physical Sunscreen SPF 50 Plus\". its the same as this cream, but its more liqiudy. I spray it into my hands and then I rub it into my face. And then the secont top sunscreen is with the \"Replenix Sheer Physical Sunscreen Cream\". I used to just use the \"Replenix Sheer Physical Sunscreen Cream\", but it didnt worked always well with my face creams. So if I use the spray first and then the cream its a perfect mix, since then I dont have any crumbs builded up!!! And I have the best protection against the sun, because its doubled! Then my make up goes smothly on my skin and it last the whole day. I used to have really oily skin, but now I dont have it anymore when I use this sunscreen, I think its because of the green tee extract and zinc. I love Replenix so much! Cant live without it. There is no white cast! Its the first mineral sunscreen with no white cast!',\n",

       "   'the best This is soooo good, it does not leave a white cast and goes on smoothly. Leaves your face a little shiny, but compared to other mineral sunscreen, its no big deal. You can always fix it with some powder or something. Does not irritate my face, sits nicely. Wish it came in a bigger bottle :(',\n",

I’ve never used a mineral sunscreen that is this completely sheer and comfortable. NO WHITE CAST AT ALL! This is straight up Zinc Oxide and it will provide effective and robust broad spectrum protection. It doesn’t need titanium dioxide or other filters to keep it stable. The best part is that the product blends in flawlessly no matter how much you put on and with NO GREASY FEELING!! I wish it came in a larger size. Hopefully one day.',\n",

The Miracle Broth in Crème de la Mer is suspended in an extraordinary formula. The secret to activating its renewing power and enjoying its profound benefits lies in a soothing ritual. It quickly improves firmness and reduces the appearance of lines, wrinkles and the look of pores, for skin that appears virtually ageless.\\nHow to use: Crème de la Mer must be warmed for a few seconds between the fingers until it becomes translucent, then pressed gently into the skin.\\nPro tips: Mix 2–3 drops of your renewing oil into the crème and apply onto your skin for extra hydration and soothing, whenever your skin needs a little extra glow. Make this combination a part of your pre-flight ritual as well.\""
